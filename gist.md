# WEEK 17 REGEX

## Description

In our week 17 assignment, we are tasked with breaking down a REGEX (Regular Expression) and describing each section of the expression.

## Summary

I have chosen to use one of the supplied expressions from our module content, matching an email.
 The supplied expression is as follows-
 
  /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Acceptance criteria

GIVEN a regex tutorial

WHEN I open the tutorial

THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the 
regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the
regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile

WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents

THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial

WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial

THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does

WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial

THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
